# Whiteboard-Final
This is our final project for our CS 151 Object Oriented Design course. It essentially works similarly to Microsoft's Paint program and was meant to cover a vast majority of the topics we had learned in the course over the semester. 

We've included an executable .jar file that can be run after downloading the repository to your system. To run the program from command line simply write "java -jar Whiteboard.jar" and the program will launch.
